            This site is designed as a way for artists to easily host their body of work online, to make it shareable with prospective employers, commissioners, or anyone who they wish to show their work to. In the gallery view (above), people who were linked to a portfolio can scroll through all of the work they have uploaded, and click on each thumbnail to bring up the picture and some information the artist has written about it.
        </p>

        <p class="w-75 mx-auto mb-5 h5 font-weight-normal">
            Uploading images is a simple and streamlined process. Users just need to click on the upload button to select an image, and type descriptive text in the appropriate field. If the artist later wants to change any of the text information or switch the image, that can be done by selecting the appropriate image from the dashboard page.
