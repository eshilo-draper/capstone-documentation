            <h3>About Ethan</h3>
            <p>
                I am an aspiring software engineer from Gill, Massachusetts. My inspiration for this project came from my love of art and creation, as I have been drawing for as long as I have been able to hold a writing implement. I have also found creativity to be a big part of software development and engineering, which is what gave me an interest in the field and led me down the path I am on today.
            </p>
